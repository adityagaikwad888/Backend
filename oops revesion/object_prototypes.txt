1) Internaly Arrays in js are also object

2) Prototypes are the mechanism by which javaScript objects inherit features from one another.
It is like a single template object that all objects inherit methods and properties from without having their own copy.
      - Every object in javaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object,
        so the prototype will ahve its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends
        when we reach a prototype that has null for own prototype.  

        ~ arr.__proto__()  --> this will just pointer to the actual prototype.
        ~ Array.prototype()  --> this is original prototype for Array object.
